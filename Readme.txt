During each iteration of the main loop, for each robot in the team, a random number between 0 and 100 is generated. If this number exceeds 50, the robot initiates a search. It looks around, examining the field of view of other robots to identify any common landmarks that trigger the generation of new transactions. Once all team members have completed their random searches, one robot is chosen at random to locate its designated home, predetermined at the outset of the experiment. This robot then traverses the blockchain and transactions to locate its home, utilizing the field of view information submitted by other robots in the blockchain. After determining the shortest path, another random process is executed, involving the movement of robots within the environment. In this process, the replacement of robots is constrained to their current positions, mirroring real-world actions more closely. In this scenario, there's a 66 percent chance of robots being moved to enhance their dynamism within the environment. Subsequently, a new iteration of the loop begins.
